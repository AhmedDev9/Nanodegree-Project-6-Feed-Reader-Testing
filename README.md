===========================================
Welcome to Project 6 - Feed Reader Testing with Jasmine


Quick start "How to run this app":

- This app provides the following 4 Feeds: "Udacity Blog", "CSS Tricks", "HTML Rocks" and "Linear Degression"

- The screen is divided into 2 parts: The upper part contains the App Functionality and the lower part the Jasmine Tests

- The Functionality part gives you the possibility to switch between the above mentioned Feeds, each Feed displays 4 feed entries per default and a click on a feed entry opens the feed article

- The Tests part shows the result of all the Jasmine tests that ran upon loading the app

- Running the tests successfully (all dots are green) assures that the required functionality works as expected

- The following functionality is being tested:
-- All Feeds are defined, have an url and name
-- The menu is hidden per default and toggles its visibility by clicking on the menu icon
-- Every Feed loads at least one feed entry
-- When selecting a different Feed the page content changes

- All Tests have been tested to run successfully, indicated by a row of 17 green dots and/or "17 specs, 0 failures"
